# Toa Configuration Extension

## Problem Definition

- It should be possible to reuse a component operations in different contexts and deployment environments, that is in
  different configurations.
- It should be possible to deploy algorithm parameters secretly.

## Definitions

### Configuration (Distributed System Configuration)

Set of static[^1] parameters for all algorithms within a given system.

### Component Configuration

Subset of Configuration for algorithms within a component.

### Context Configuration

Set of values that overrides default values for configuration of components added to a given context.

## Responsibility Segregation

Component Configuration is a schema defining the *form* of configuration. Specific *values* for this schema are
defined by Context Configuration.

## Component Configuration

Component Configuration is declared as a component extension using JSONSchema `object` type.

> Yet there is no way to provide configuration values without a deployment, it is recommended to have default values
> for all required parameters to be able to run operations locally.

### Example

> Well-known shortcut `configuration` is available.

```yaml
# component.toa.yaml
domain: dummies
name: dummy

configuration:
  properties:
    foo:
      type: string
      default: 'baz'
    bar:
      type: number
  required: [foo]
```

## Context Configuration

Context Configuration is declared as a context extension. Configuration keys may
be defined with [deployment environment discriminators](#).

### Example

```yaml
# context.toa.yaml
configuration:
  dummies.dummy:
    foo: quu
    bar: 1
    bar@staging: 2
```

## Secrets

Context Configuration values which are uppercase strings prefixed with `$` considered as Secrets.

### Example

```yaml
# context.toa.yaml
configuration:
  payments.gateway:
    api-key: $STRIPE_API_KEY
```

### Secrets Deployment

Secrets are not being deployed with context deployment ([`toa deploy`](#)), thus must be deployed separately once for
each deployment environment manually ([`toa conceal`](#)).

<dl>

<dt><code>$ toa conceal</code></dt>
<dd>Finds all secrets declared in a context, prompts values for those which hasn't been deployed yet and 
deploys those keys with provided values.

<code>--reset</code> don't skip deployed secrets</dd>

<dt><code>$ toa conceal &lt;key&gt; &lt;value&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>Checks if a given <code>key</code> is a declared secret and deploys it with a given <code>value</code></dd>

</dl>

## Context

Component configuration values are available as an operation context extension.

### Usage: node

```javascript
// underlay
context.configiuration.foo

// invoke
context.extensions.configuration('foo')
```

> ![Warning](https://img.shields.io/badge/Warning-yellow)<br/>
> It is strongly **not** recommended to store a copy of value type configuration values outside of operation scope, thus
> it prevents operation to benefit from [hot updates](#).
>
> ```javascript
> // THIS IS WEIRD, BAD AND NOT RECOMMENDED
> let foo
> 
> function transition (input, entity, context) {
>   if (foo === undefined) foo = context.configuration.foo
> }
> ```
> See [genuine operations](#).

## Appendix

- [Discussion](./docs/discussion.md)
- [Configuration consistency](./docs/consistency.md) has yet to be implemented.

[^1]: That is canâ€™t be changed without a deployment. This is because new values considered to be a subject of
testing. [#146](https://github.com/toa-io/toa/issues/146)
