# Productivity Notes

1. **Sleep well and sleep enough.** And drink water.
2. **Avoid context switching.** Having a user manual helps.
3. **Get rid of realtime communications[^1].** Two weekly meetings plus morning emails is enough.
4. **Be comfortable.** Get noise canceling headphones, height adjustable desk and a chair your back
   will love.
5. **Be disciplined.** Don't waste your creativity trying to bend the rules.
6. **Don't rush.** You'll make mistakes and be slower.
7. **Don't work overtime.** You'll pay double the next day.
8. **Listen to what bearded or gray-haired people say.**
9. **Be happy.** Meet your friends and family.
