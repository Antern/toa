# Development Requirements

## Unit of Work

[TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is considered to be the only known way
(but not guarantee) to create *non-broken software*. Minimal developer's unit of work is one
iteration of TDD cycle.

## Commits

### Commit Granularity

Small commits are [better](https://gitforteams.com/resources/commit-granularity.html) than big ones.

If you find yourself confused when you should commit changes, imagine you have a permanent question
from your boss: **What have you done?**

Then, each time you have a reasonable answer to it, you should commit. And that answer should be
your commit message (in the form conforming to commit message convention).
